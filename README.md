# CogccAutoDownloader

An extremely early version of a scraper for the COGCC website.
It accurately downloads the first page of reports but due to poor pagination (or lack thereof) the other pages are hard to reach.
Working on a alternative to beautifulsoup4 package for downloading ALL pages, thinking of using scrapy but unable to find time due to other priorities.
Another problem would be the region blocking for some countries. Using a VPN or running this script in a Virtual Machine fixes this glaring issue. One could also use the STEM package accessing the website using TOR, but it makes me question if any legal issues are there or not for this action.
